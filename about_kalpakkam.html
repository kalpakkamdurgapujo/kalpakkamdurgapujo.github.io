			<p>Fifty kilometers of drive down the East Coast Road (ECR) from
			Adyar, Chennai along the coastline of Bay of Bengal and nineteen kilometers further down beyond Mahabalipuram (totally 69 kilometers), lies the oldest and biggest township, Kalpakkam (~80% of population). The township, surrounded by the historic village Sadras (at its North), Pudupattinam (South) and the seacoast, was set up more than three decades back. The expansion of the existing facilities and introduction of new projects led to the planning and arrival of two new townships, Amaipakkam (~mid 90â€™s) and Anupuram (Year, 2000). Both the townships are located at around 10 kilometers west to Kalpakkam.</p>
		</div>
		<p>The township is famous for its backwaters and is situated on the shores of Bay of Bengal and boasts of a scenic backwater situated at the heart of the township.</p>
		<p>The townships represent a true cross-section of the Indian elites with different backgrounds, beliefs, lifestyles and languages.The meaning of the adage "unity in diversity " becomes clear when you visit this picturesque township.</p>
